Untangle your code with yield
=============================

Generators and iterators are among the most enigmatic and underused 
features of ECMAScript 2015.  They can be used to create custom 
iterables and infinite sequences. Lesser known applications include 
controlling asynchronous operations and handling side effects.

In this talk I'll demonstrate how generators can be successfully used to 
write elegant and performant code.  I'll start by explaining how they 
work and what they are good for.  I'll then show you how to bend the 
rules of space and time, and how to tame Promises and other 
abstractions with `yield`.  Finally I'll present a hands-on example of 
how generators can be used to refactor code which otherwise would be 
tedious to maintain and reason about.
